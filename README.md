# Drift.js

A 2D drifting game written in native JavaScript using a bunch of math, `HTML <canvas>`, and the coolest `<div>` on the planet. `HTML <canvas>` was used purely for the tyre marks. Rendering is handled with `requestAnimationFrame()`. Since the animation speed is tied to framerate, I've had to throttle it to 60 FPS, otherwise you will be absolutely zooming on a high refresh rate display.

## Built with
